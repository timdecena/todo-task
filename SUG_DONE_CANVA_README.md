Use this as your speaking guide during report/demo.

## 1. Introduction

Today I will present **Sug Done**, a smart task management application designed to help users stay organized and avoid missed deadlines.

Sug Done is not just a simple CRUD task app.  
It provides multiple views like **Table**, **Kanban**, and **Calendar**, along with smart deadline tracking and recovery features.

Short line you can say:
- "Sug Done helps users see, prioritize, and complete tasks with less stress."

## 2. Problem Statement (Mark Scenario)

Mark is a software developer working on many tasks every day.  
He writes some tasks in notes, some in chat, and some in a basic task app.

He is busy all day, but he is not sure which task is most important.  
One time, he deletes a task by mistake and cannot get it back.  
He also forgets to repeat a weekly report.

The problem is not that Mark is lazy.  
The problem is he does not have a clear and smart way to manage his tasks.

Short line you can say:
- "Without one clear system, tasks become scattered, forgotten, or lost."

## 3. Solution Overview

That is why **Sug Done** was created.

Sug Done solves Mark's problems by giving:
- One organized workspace for tasks
- Clear priority and deadline visibility
- Multiple working views (Table, Kanban, Calendar)
- Recovery support like Undo Delete
- Better consistency for repeated work

Short line you can say:
- "Sug Done turns task tracking from manual and messy into clear and reliable."

## 4. Technical Stack

Sug Done is built using modern full-stack technologies.

The frontend uses **TypeScript with Vite** to make development faster and **Ant Design** to create a clean and professional interface.

The backend uses **Spring Boot 17** to handle system logic and process requests.

The database uses **MySQL**, managed with **MySQL Workbench** to store and organize data properly.

The system follows a **layered structure** to keep code clean, organized, and easy to maintain.

Architecture summary:
- **Monolithic full-stack architecture**
- Frontend and backend are separate codebases
- Backend uses layered design:
  - Controller layer (API endpoints)
  - Service layer (business logic)
  - Repository layer (data access)

Short line you can say:
- "The stack is modern, maintainable, and practical for real team use."

## Quick Closing Line
